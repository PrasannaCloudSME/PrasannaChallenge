# PrasannaChallenge


Challenge #1
A 3-tier environment is a common setup.

Challenge #2
We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within Azure

Challenge #3
We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get
back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a
